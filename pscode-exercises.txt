// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input num1
Input num2

Sum = num1 + num2


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input number
Check if number is divisible by 2
If yes: Even
If no: Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Input num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

b) Average = Sum divided by 5
Sum = num 1+num2+num3+num4+num5

c) minimum = smallest of num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
maximum = largest of num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

d) display minimum
display maximum
